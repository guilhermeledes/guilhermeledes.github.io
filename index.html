        <p>Over the past 16 years I have played various roles and worked in several project areas, such as healthcare, human resources, warehouse management, banking and others.</p>
        <p>I developed a keen eye for the bigger picture of the projects, and I'm aways committed to implementing best practices and methodologies that enhance the entire development life-cycle of the project I'm involved on.</p>
        <p>This includes adopting industry-standard, such as Domain Driven Design, Design Patterns, SOLID principles and Test-Driven Development. I would also point out Clean Code and Refactoring as catalogs used in my day-to-day work and the application
            of architectural patterns such as Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture or Onion Architecture.</p>
